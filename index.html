      <h2 id="about">About Carlos Alvarado</h2>

      <p>
        My name is Carlos Alvarado. I am from Chelsea, Massachusetts and have
        lived there all my life. My family immigrated there from Honduras in the
        80s and 90s. Their immigrant stories along with many others in Chelsea
        have molded me into the man that I am today. While my parents placed
        heavy emphasis on education when I was a child, it took me some time to
        figure that out for myself. I always loved to learn but never realized
        how much of a privilege it is to be able to learn. I attended Beacon
        Academy, a school for underprivileged, innercity kids in Boston that
        prepares them for private high schools and all that entails attending
        those types of school. We gained both academic and social education.
        Classes ranged from Algebra to Latin to "Life at a PWI" to name a few.
        After leaving this school, I attended Milton Academy, a boarding school
        where I spent 4 years. Being at this school, I was able to play varsity
        sports and enjoyed my time on the soccer team as it built my sense of
        camaraderie. Being away from home made my heart grow fonder for Chelsea
        while also realizing there should be more kids like me experiencing the
        life I had and I wanted to find a way to tangibly achieve this. That is
        when I discovered Babson College.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I finished my time in high school, I hoped to find purpose in my
        actions, not wanting to waste time as the pandemic came to a close and
        the world began opening up again. It wasn't until the end of my senior
        year in High School when I realized where my passion was. After
        rekindling my friendship with a childhood friend, I began working with
        him to grow the clothing brand he was working, a brand named Kliq. After
        seeing the backend of what goes into everything; from inception of an
        idea to the rollout and everything inbetween, I fell in love. While
        normally, I would have to choose between my passion and education,
        coming to Babson allowed me to intertwine the two and allowed me to
        develop the brand further than I would have been able to in any other
        circumstance. My time here at Babson has been molded around both
        developing my skills pertaining to strategy, consulting, and project
        management while also pursuing experiences that would be applicable to
        Kliq and my role as the COO of the brand. Beyond the courses and
        experiences I have had here at Babson, the most important and
        influential part would be the relationships I have built with my peers.
        Following my freshman year, I felt I had not lived to the fullest which
        prompted me to join Alpha Kappa Psi, the oldest and largest business
        fraternity in the world. Being drawn in my that moniker, I hesitantly
        joined and did not regret it. I was exposed to the most down to earth
        and genuine people I had met at Babson and completely shattered my
        perception of what someone needed to be like to succeed. Joining AKPsi
        allowed me to build my confidence even greater while understanding the
        importance of paying everything you are given forward. I was taken under
        the wing of senior brothers who inspired me to continue the cycle and
        serve as a mentor to younger members of the fraternity now that I am the
        senior. Overall, my experience at Babson has allowed me to cut out the
        unnecessary of my life while also reinforcing the type of impact and man
        I want to be moving forward. My time here allowed me to understand what
        my high school aspirations can tangibly look like and motivated me to
        continue my pursuit of not only academic educational equality but
        democratization of social capital as well.

      <h2 id="interests">My Interests</h2>

      <p>
        Growing up, I was extremely passionate about sports as my parents had me
        try everything at least once before I decided it wasn't for me. I played
        football, baseball, basketball, and soccer to name a few. After years of
        experience and learning about each sport, I realized that my favorite
        was soccer. I have been a Real Madrid supporter all my life and used to
        dream of playing for the club as a child. After realizing that I would
        not be the next Cristiano Ronaldo, I pivoted to my current passion for
        fashion. (unintended rhyme!) This passion was sparked by my
        aforementioned involvement in
        <a href="https://www.kliqbrand.com/">Kliq</a> with my best friend
        Javier. While I had always loved to dress myself and been intrigued by
        sneakers and clothes, joining Kliq allowed for me to learn first-hand
        about everything that intrigued me. I love the logistics that go into
        planning a collection and because of this, I have fallen in love with
        studying the rollouts of other businesses and brands. I have
        romanticized the process in a way that my hobby has become my dream and
        my passion. I have become a student of the industry, hoping to be a
        sponge whenever possible.
