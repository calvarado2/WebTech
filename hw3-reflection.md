1. Development Reflection
I struggled initially with understanding the issue of why my code was not working for the following steps after it had worked for the first section worked. While you said in the instructions that we shouldn't edit the files themselves, I realized that I was calling to different .js files that did not exist since all my edits were in hw3-1.js and not in separate .js files for each phase of the assignment. I solved it by scrolling through the entirety of each file downloaded and troubleshooting different edits until I asked AI what a potential issue could be and it did not initially give me the answer but gave me the idea to check through all scripts and naming conventions. I realized that each file only had one script line so it had to be the name of the file which it was in the end.
I learned a lot about trouble shooting in this assignment as I was limited with the types of edits I can make across files as I was restricted to only changing one file. This helped me in branching out from my typical thought process as having all the script in its own place made me see the code differently and allowed me to see clearer than I normally do. I also continued to improve my AI conversation ability.
1. AI Usage Summary
I used Cursor once I began using AI specifically the gemini 2.5 that they have available as a language model. This helped me as it not only gave suggestions for code but explained what the code was doing and acknowledged that there could be better/more efficient ways to carry out the task. When I did ask for help, I specifically fed it the restrictions that were given in instructions before asking for specific advice with things, like find the error in my code or how would I go about implementing the cards in a straightforward fashion. I often times did not use the exact suggestion that was given to me by the AI but it made me see things as if they were far more obvious after seeing its attempt at times. For example, it struggled with finishing touches on a lot of code and was rough around the edges which required me to delete or add code to make it all flow better. 
1. Reflection on AI Collaboration
The obvious limitation of using AI tools in web development is that the AI could potentially do the majority of the heavy lifting in terms of actually writing out all the code depending on how you use it. That is primarily the biggest limitation as, similar to the calculator, people will begin to stop using the muscle to actually code manually. There are a lot of advantages however as it democratizes the ability to code for yourself as even a beginner can create elaborate websites with the help of AI. AI allows for the possibilities to go beyond what beginners like myself could have imagined while also shortening the time for even the most experienced coders that enables them to focus on the things AI still has yet to master. I would advise myself not to be afraid to use AI but to be aware of everything that I am doing so that I am not mindlessly allowing the AI to overtake my projects.
