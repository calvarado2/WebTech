        A baby elephant hanging out with its mom, aunts, great-aunts, and maybe
        even its grandmother.

      <div class="leftcol">
        It's hard to tell what goes through a baby elephant's mind when its mom
        is trying to put it to sleep. Do you think baby elephants wake up in the
        middle of the night and cry? Do their moms and dads take turns getting
        up with them to rock them back to sleep? How do you rock an elephant,
        anyway? And what about gorillas?
      </div>

      <div class="rightcol">
        Today in the paper there's a story about a new gorilla that was just
        born in Franklin Park. Its mom is holding on to it just like any proud
        human mom. And I have to wonder if they go through as much trauma as
        that human mom when it comes to sleep, food, and diapers, and running
        into the street.
      </div>

      <div class="textcol">
        Why is it so easy for them? Are they better parents? Do they just not
        worry about every little detail? I've never known a gorilla to read and
        study carefully seventeen books on bringing up baby gorillas. And they
        seem to know just what to do. They never worry about spoiling their
        little gorilla babies. They never worry about not having enough time
        with them. Now, don't get me wrong, I'd rather be human than a gorilla
        any day. Just imagine having to sit in a zoo. (Did you figure out yet
        that while gorillas were on my mind, I could only find a picture of an
        elephant?)
